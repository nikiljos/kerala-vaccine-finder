# Kerala Vaccine Finder

## Inspiration
Finding a vaccination slot using the government's website is a bit hard as it list all sessions(including unavailable slots together) This makes it hard to search for available slots especially in mobile devices

## What it does
The website I built uses the government CoWin APIs to fetch the details of vaccination centers in the selected district and show the details of all the available slots in a simple and mobile friendly UI.

## How I built it
The site is built using NodeJS with frameworks like express, axios, ejs etc. Uses CoWin API to get the data.

## Challenges I ran into
CoWin API had some restrictions on server locations. So the app will not run properly in heroku as it's servers are not in India

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The site is running without errors in development server

## What I learned
I learned a lot about EJS, Express and routing sites. Also I got to know a lot about hosting sites.

## What's next for Kerala Vaccine Finder
A telegram bot that sends alerts every 10 minutes about the available vaccination slots
